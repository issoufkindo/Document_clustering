# Document_clustering
SKLearn clustering.


This set of jupiter notebook code is
clustering a set of patent in the
first part. And, in the second part
is doing a topic modeling using gensim.
The clustering algorithm uses KMeans.
And, it clusters data into 4 different
clusters. lastly, we have built a
representation for these clusters
into 4 different word clouds.
the last part, the topic modeling,
classifies the data into 4 topics
and topics are represented by the
LDA model plotted at the bottom. This representation
corresponds to the most popular words in the
previous  4 clusters. we can safely say that
these topics correspond to the clusters.

/* I will attach a scrip and an ipynb file to this project
*  please run this code in jupiter it will run in the
*  terminal but it will not show the topic modeling part.
